            "During the spring of 2012, I was fortunate to have Carl as a student in my class on Data Joumalism and Information Visualization at Columbia Journalism School. Throughout the semester, Carl proved to be a bright, dedicated student and valuable team partner whose enthusiasm, insight, and considerable skills enhanced both classroom discussions and his individual and group projects. Unlike most of his classmates, Carl arrived in my class with a fair amount of experience in programming and web development, having created content management systems for small websites for several years. Though this meant that Carl was already familiar with many of the concepts we discussed in class - especially during our programming labs - he engaged fully with all of the lessons and class discussions, using his existing skills as a springboard to take given assignments above and beyond what was required, rather than using them as a crutch to skate through the material. This was evident most distinctly towards the end of the semester, when, having had to miss some weeks of school due to very significant personal loss, Carl not only made up his missed assignments but went beyond a simple blog response and executed his final critiques with a level of rigor and detail that would be welcome in any professional circle. He also redoubled his contributions to his group’s final project, which was one of the class’s most sophisticated and successful.Carl's unique critical, academic and personal achievement led me to award him the only honor's designation among the 15 students in my class – a recognition that he richly deserves. He is a person whom I would gladly welcome as a newsroom colleague myself, and I think any organization that has the opportunity to work with him will quickly feel the same."

            "While Carl was a student at Mercer University, I had the pleasure of working with him on many projects aimed at Macon's revitalization. In general, Mercer University recruits, nurtures and graduates people who are interested in making positive changes in their communities. Carl exemplified this trait at Mercer, spending time in and out of the classroom improving Macon. I cannot imagine any non-profit in Macon would be as successful without the support of Mercer and Mercer students. In particular, I want to recommend Carl's work on CollegeTownMacon.com. Although tens of thousands of college students attend school in Macon, it has been difficult to connect these students with businesses and activities in the community. We want students to see Macon as their college experience, and not just their specific campus. Carl led a 200-level class in Civic and Community Journalism to build a website to provide an online directory for local experiences for College students to solve this problem. The entire course was built around the production of this website, making Carl largely responsible for the syllabus, including organizing and assigning tasks and research, providing instruction and training for technical, interview and writing skills, managing work flow, editing content and ensuring the timely completion of tasks. Carl's management skills in this course brought together two of his best skills: teaching and project management. By the end of the course, Carl's class delivered a functional website that led a cultural shift among college students in Macon that has had a long-term impact in Macon with more students involved in the community and driving economic development. Carl taught students new skills and then helped those students apply those skills to solve real world problems and have a positive impact in the community. That's an accomplishment that many seasoned instructors struggle to achieve."

            "During his senior year of college, Carl V. helped me make a long-held dream come true by almost single-handedly conceiving, building and launching the website for The Cluster. Carl V. and I started the conversation about the website in class, and I immediately knew that I had finally found someone who had the skills and drive to make my goal of bringing the newspaper online a reality. Within a month of our initial conversation, Carl had built an easy to use platform, based on Wordpress, for the website. Of our staff of 10 editors, few had experience using Wordpress, and Carl was able to quickly train the editors and myself on posting to and updating the website. He also wrote up documentation for the editors to reference in case they needed help, which allowed them and Carl to use their time more efficiently. The website launched in late February 2011, too late for entry into the Georgia College Press Association awards, but the website that Carl built won 1st place in the 'Best Website' category the following year. Three years later, the website is still running smoothly, which is largely thanks to the extensive manual that Carl developed and left with my successor. Thanks to his effort, The Cluster is now available online and on a mobile app. Carl is able to patiently and efficiently teach new skills to others, and his passion for his work shows through."
